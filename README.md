## 🧠 About Me

I’m a data scientist and **AI/LLM enthusiast** passionate about building solutions at the intersection of public health, machine learning, and generative models. I’m particularly excited about using **language models (LLMs)** and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** to assist real-world decision-making in healthcare and other high-impact domains.

My academic journey spans diverse domains—from **Globalization at Dartmouth**, where I supported high-impact organizations, to **Microbiology and Psychology** at the **University of Hawaii**, and now to building **ML and NLP tools in healthcare** at Harvard.

Leadership and mentorship highlights:
- VP, Harvard Graduate Consulting Club
- Mentor, **StatStart Program**
- Contributor, Harvard Medical School’s **Health Professions Recruitment & Exposure Program (HPREP)**

## 📌 Featured Projects

| Project | Description | Tech Stack |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **AI Research Assistant** | Built a chatbot using open-source LLMs (e.g., Mistral via Hugging Face) to help researchers extract and reflect on insights from multi-session interview transcripts. | Python, HuggingFace, Streamlit |
| **BranchRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation System** | Designed and implemented a modular RAG pipeline to ground LLM responses in domain-specific documents for more accurate and verifiable outputs. Integrated FAISS for semantic search, FastAPI for API interface, and Hugging Face's Mistral model for generation. Includes logging, testing, and a Streamlit UI for rapid evaluation. | Python, FAISS, Hugging Face, FastAPI, Streamlit, Docker |
| **Deidentifier Tool** | Developed an NLP pipeline to detect and redact personally identifiable information (PII) from clinical transcripts using spaCy and Presidio. | Python, FastAPI, Docker |
