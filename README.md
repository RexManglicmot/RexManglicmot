## üìå Featured Projects (Continuously Working)

| Project | Description | Tech Stack |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **AI Research Assistant** | Built a chatbot using open-source LLMs (e.g., Mistral via Hugging Face) to help researchers extract and reflect on insights from multi-session interview transcripts. | Python, HuggingFace, Streamlit |
| **BranchRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation System** | Designed and implemented a modular RAG pipeline to ground LLM responses in domain-specific documents for more accurate and verifiable outputs. Integrated FAISS for semantic search, FastAPI for API interface, and Hugging Face's Mistral model for generation. Includes logging, testing, and a Streamlit UI for rapid evaluation. | Python, FAISS, Hugging Face, FastAPI, Streamlit, Docker |
| **Deidentifier Tool** | Developed an NLP pipeline to detect and redact personally identifiable information (PII) from clinical transcripts using spaCy and Presidio. | Python, FastAPI, Docker |
